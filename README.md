# Academic_Performance_Analysis
Challenge assignment for Module 4

## Background
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

### Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the effects of attempting to correct what may have been record tampering on the score of Thomas High School. At this point in time, the school board has no evidence who altered the scores of Thomas HS's 9th graders and need to determine if whatever alterations took place severely affected Thomas HS's standing in the district.
